			<h2>Subtheme: Corporate Landlords & Evictions</h2>

			<p>
			  Prior research (such as the Homes For All report below) has shown that corporate and absentee landlords evicted more people during COVID in the state of MA. Evictions can have devastating impacts on residents, families and communities. Conversely, live-in (or live-nearby) landlords tended to file for fewer evictions, leading the report to make a recommendation that local control of property contributes to housing stability. Communities of color, especially Black and Latinx people, faced particularly high rates of eviction. Do these findings hold up in the City of Boston? Are there more evictions in census tracts with less owners living in them? How have rates of owner occupancy and corporate ownership in Boston changed over time? Are there more corporate landlords now than there have been in the past?

	      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This report explores neighborhood-level changes in corporate ownership and owner-occupancy across Boston from
        2004 to 2024, using property assessment-derived rates combined with neighborhood Census fields (population,
        race/ethnicity counts, and housing unit counts). The goal is not to make causal claims, but to identify
        patterns, outliers, and plausible hypotheses that can guide deeper analysis in later assignments.
      </p>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How have corporate ownership and owner-occupancy rates changed across Boston neighborhoods from 2004–2024?</li>
				<li>Are neighborhoods with higher shares of Black and Hispanic residents associated with lower owner-occupancy or higher corporate ownership?</li>
				<li>Is higher corporate ownership associated with lower housing stability indicators (e.g., vacancy rate or lower owner-occupancy)?</li>
				<li>Do neighborhoods experiencing population growth or housing unit expansion also show faster increases in corporate ownership?</li>
			</ol>

      <h3>Data used</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Corporate ownership & owner-occupancy over time (2004–2024):</strong> neighborhood-year rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Corporate ownership & owner-occupancy with Census fields:</strong> neighborhood-year rates merged with neighborhood population and housing unit counts.</li>
        <li><strong>Neighborhoods & zip codes:</strong> a lookup table used for reference/joins when needed.</li>
      </ul>
