			<h2>Subtheme: Corporate Landlords & Evictions</h2>

			<p>
			  Prior research (such as the Homes For All report below) has shown that corporate and absentee landlords evicted more people during COVID in the state of MA. Evictions can have devastating impacts on residents, families and communities. Conversely, live-in (or live-nearby) landlords tended to file for fewer evictions, leading the report to make a recommendation that local control of property contributes to housing stability. Communities of color, especially Black and Latinx people, faced particularly high rates of eviction. Do these findings hold up in the City of Boston? Are there more evictions in census tracts with less owners living in them? How have rates of owner occupancy and corporate ownership in Boston changed over time? Are there more corporate landlords now than there have been in the past?

	      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This report explores neighborhood-level changes in corporate ownership and owner-occupancy across Boston from
        2004 to 2024, using property assessment-derived rates combined with neighborhood Census fields (population,
        race/ethnicity counts, and housing unit counts). The goal is not to make causal claims, but to identify
        patterns, outliers, and plausible hypotheses that can guide deeper analysis in later assignments.
      </p>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How have corporate ownership and owner-occupancy rates changed across Boston neighborhoods from 2004–2024?</li>
				<li>Are neighborhoods with higher shares of Black and Hispanic residents associated with lower owner-occupancy or higher corporate ownership?</li>
				<li>Is higher corporate ownership associated with lower housing stability indicators (e.g., vacancy rate or lower owner-occupancy)?</li>
				<li>Do neighborhoods experiencing population growth or housing unit expansion also show faster increases in corporate ownership?</li>
			</ol>

      <h3>Data used</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Corporate ownership & owner-occupancy over time (2004–2024):</strong> neighborhood-year rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Corporate ownership & owner-occupancy with Census fields:</strong> neighborhood-year rates merged with neighborhood population and housing unit counts.</li>
        <li><strong>Neighborhoods & zip codes:</strong> a lookup table used for reference/joins when needed.</li>
      </ul>

	<p class="note">
        <strong>Important note on measurement:</strong> Corporate ownership is inferred via keyword matching in owner names
        (e.g., “LLC”, “Trust”), which may undercount or misclassify some owners. Owner-occupancy and corporate ownership
        are expressed as rates (0–1) at the neighborhood-year level.

    <!-- 2) DATA OVERVIEW        -->
    <!-- ===================== -->

    <section>
      <h2>2. Data Overview & Quality Checks</h2>

      <p>
        Before analyzing the research questions, I first examined the dataset structure (neighborhood-year records),
        checked coverage across years and neighborhoods, and inspected distributions and potential data quality issues
        (e.g., missingness, outliers, and unexpected discontinuities over time).
      </p>

      <h3>Visualization 0-a: Dataset coverage / missingness</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/Visualization 0A.png" alt="Dataset coverage and missingness by field or year" />
        <figcaption>
          For this first exploratory view, I focused on understanding what the dataset contains and whether anything 
		  looked “off” at a glance. I scanned for unusually high or low values, abrupt year-to-year jumps, and gaps that
		  might indicate missing records or inconsistencies—flagging potential anomalies worth double-checking before moving into deeper analysis.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Visualization 0-b: Distribution of corporate ownership rate (example year: 2024)</h3>

        <figcaption>
          Here, I looked up where each neighborhood sits in Boston and selected six that together provide a broad 
		  geographic cross-section of the city (central, north, east, south, and outer-edge areas). This subset is 
		  meant to anchor later comparisons by representing distinct parts of Boston rather than focusing only on the 
		  neighborhoods with the highest or lowest values.

          Caption: Describe the spread of owner-occupancy rates and note which neighborhoods appear to be outliers
          (very low or very high). Mention any “gut check” expectations (e.g., central/student-heavy areas may cluster low).

      <h2>3. Discoveries & Insights</h2>

      <!-- ===================== -->
      <!-- RQ1: Long-run trends   -->
      <!-- ===================== -->
      <h3>Research Question 1: How have corporate ownership and owner-occupancy rates changed across Boston neighborhoods from 2004–2024?</h3>
      <p>
        I first examine neighborhood-level time series to see whether changes are widespread or concentrated, and whether certain
        neighborhoods show distinct inflection points.
      </p>

      <h4>Visualization 1-a: Neighborhood trends over time (all neighborhoods)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/Figure 1.png" alt="Ownership trends over time across all neighborhoods" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Corporate ownership increases in most neighborhoods, but at different speeds.</strong>
          Replace with 2–4 sentences describing whether most lines trend upward, whether some neighborhoods diverge strongly from the pack,
          and whether there are visible periods where growth accelerates (e.g., mid-2010s). Note any neighborhoods that remain relatively stable
          as useful contrasts.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>Visualization 1-b: Dual trend example (selected neighborhoods)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_1B_selected_dual_trends.png" alt="Selected neighborhoods showing corporate ownership and owner occupancy trends side-by-side" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>In selected neighborhoods, corporate ownership growth coincides with lower owner-occupancy.</strong>
          Replace with 2–4 sentences: explain why these neighborhoods were selected (e.g., largest increases, distinct neighborhood types),
          and describe whether rising corporate ownership corresponds with falling owner-occupancy. If any neighborhood breaks that pattern,
          call it out as a potential outlier worth investigating.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <!-- ===================== -->
      <!-- RQ2: Where change is concentrated -->
      <!-- ===================== -->
      <h3>Research Question 2: Which neighborhoods experienced the largest shifts between 2004 and 2024?</h3>
      <p>
        To identify where ownership restructuring is most concentrated, I compare the change in corporate ownership from 2004 to 2024 across
        neighborhoods and highlight the largest movers.
      </p>

      <h4>Visualization 2-a: Largest changes from 2004 to 2024</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_1C_delta_bar.png" alt="Bar chart of change in corporate ownership from 2004 to 2024 by neighborhood" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Corporate ownership growth is concentrated in a subset of neighborhoods.</strong>
          The largest increases occur in areas like South Boston Waterfront, East Boston, and Fenway (each roughly +25 to +32 percentage points),
          while outer neighborhoods such as Hyde Park and West Roxbury increase more modestly (around +10 to +12 points). This distribution suggests
          that investor expansion is not uniform, and may track redevelopment intensity and rental-dominant markets.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <!-- ===================== -->
      <!-- RQ3: Demographics / equity -->
      <!-- ===================== -->
      <h3>Research Question 3: Are neighborhoods with higher shares of Black and Hispanic residents associated with higher corporate ownership or lower owner-occupancy?</h3>
      <p>
        To explore equity implications, I compare ownership measures to neighborhood racial/ethnic composition by computing demographic shares
        (e.g., % Black = black_all / tot_pop_all; % Hispanic = hisp_all / tot_pop_all). Because this is neighborhood-level aggregation, results
        are descriptive and may hide within-neighborhood variation.
      </p>

      <h4>Visualization 3-a: Corporate ownership vs % Black (2024)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_2A_corp_vs_pct_black_2024.png" alt="Scatterplot of corporate ownership vs percent Black residents, 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>At the neighborhood scale, corporate ownership is not highest in the highest-% Black neighborhoods.</strong>
          In 2024, corporate ownership shows a negative association with % Black residents (approximately r ≈ −0.63), with the highest corporate ownership
          concentrated in central neighborhoods that are not the highest-% Black. This complicates a simple “corporate ownership concentrates in Black neighborhoods”
          narrative and suggests additional neighborhood factors (e.g., centrality, housing stock, student markets) may shape investor patterns.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>Visualization 3-b: Corporate ownership vs % Hispanic (2024)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_2B_corp_vs_pct_hisp_2024.png" alt="Scatterplot of corporate ownership vs percent Hispanic residents, 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>The relationship with % Hispanic is weaker overall, with meaningful neighborhood exceptions.</strong>
          Compared to % Black, the association between corporate ownership and % Hispanic is weaker in this dataset (approximately r ≈ −0.33).
          However, specific neighborhoods (e.g., East Boston) combine high Hispanic share with relatively high corporate ownership, indicating that
          equity dynamics may be localized and not fully captured by citywide linear trends.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>Visualization 3-c: Binned comparison (ownership by demographic tier)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_2C_binned_demographic_tiers.png" alt="Bar chart comparing average corporate ownership across demographic tiers" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Binning neighborhoods helps summarize equity patterns beyond individual outliers.</strong>
          This chart groups neighborhoods into tiers (e.g., terciles) based on demographic share and compares average corporate ownership (and/or owner-occupancy).
          Use this view to clarify whether differences are systematic across tiers or primarily driven by a few neighborhoods. If tier differences are small,
          that suggests the demographic relationship is weaker at the neighborhood aggregation level.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <!-- ===================== -->
      <!-- RQ4: Housing stability proxy -->
      <!-- ===================== -->
      <h3>Research Question 4: Is higher corporate ownership associated with higher vacancy or lower owner-occupancy as a housing stability proxy?</h3>
      <p>
        Since this dataset does not include eviction filings directly, I use vacancy rate as a structural indicator that can reflect housing churn
        or speculative holding. Vacancy rate is computed as vacant_unit / tot_unit, and I compare it to both corporate ownership and owner-occupancy.
      </p>

      <h4>Visualization 4-a: Vacancy rate vs corporate ownership (2024)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_3A_vacancy_vs_corp_2024.png" alt="Scatterplot of vacancy rate vs corporate ownership, 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Higher corporate ownership is associated with higher vacancy in 2024.</strong>
          Across neighborhoods, vacancy rate increases as corporate ownership increases (approximately r ≈ +0.66). Central neighborhoods such as South Boston Waterfront
          and Downtown stand out for combining high corporate ownership with high vacancy, which may reflect redevelopment dynamics, seasonal/short-term occupancy, or
          speculative holding. Importantly, vacancy is not the same as eviction, but it can help flag potentially unstable housing markets.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>Visualization 4-b: Vacancy rate vs owner-occupancy (2024)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_3B_vacancy_vs_ownerocc_2024.png" alt="Scatterplot of vacancy rate vs owner-occupancy, 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Owner-occupancy is inversely related to vacancy, reinforcing a stability contrast across neighborhoods.</strong>
          Neighborhoods with higher owner-occupancy tend to have lower vacancy, while low owner-occupancy neighborhoods are more likely to show elevated vacancy.
          Together with the strong inverse relationship between corporate ownership and owner-occupancy (about r ≈ −0.88 in 2024), this pattern suggests that
          investor-heavy, rental-dominant neighborhoods may exhibit structural signals consistent with housing churn.

    <section>
      <h2>5. Summary</h2>
      <p><strong>Main takeaways:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Corporate ownership increased substantially citywide (2004–2024)</strong> while owner-occupancy declined modestly, indicating a long-run shift toward investor-owned housing.</li>
        <li><strong>Growth is concentrated in a subset of neighborhoods</strong> (e.g., South Boston Waterfront, East Boston, Fenway), suggesting uneven investor expansion rather than uniform change.</li>
        <li><strong>At the neighborhood scale, corporate ownership is not highest in the highest-% Black neighborhoods</strong>; demographic relationships appear more complex and may be shaped by centrality, housing stock, and rental markets.</li>
        <li><strong>Corporate ownership correlates with higher vacancy</strong>, and low owner-occupancy correlates with higher vacancy—patterns consistent with housing churn, though not direct evidence of eviction.</li>
        <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> corporate ownership is inferred from owner-name matching; neighborhood aggregation can hide within-neighborhood variation; eviction filings are not included in the provided files.</li>
        <li><strong>Next step:</strong> replicate these relationships using tract-level ownership + eviction filing data (if available) to test whether investor ownership is associated with higher eviction rates in Boston.</li>
