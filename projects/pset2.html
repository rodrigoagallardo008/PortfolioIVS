			<h2>Subtheme: Corporate Landlords & Evictions</h2>

			<p>
			  Prior research (such as the Homes For All report below) has shown that corporate and absentee landlords evicted more people during COVID in the state of MA. Evictions can have devastating impacts on residents, families and communities. Conversely, live-in (or live-nearby) landlords tended to file for fewer evictions, leading the report to make a recommendation that local control of property contributes to housing stability. Communities of color, especially Black and Latinx people, faced particularly high rates of eviction. Do these findings hold up in the City of Boston? Are there more evictions in census tracts with less owners living in them? How have rates of owner occupancy and corporate ownership in Boston changed over time? Are there more corporate landlords now than there have been in the past?

	      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This report explores neighborhood-level changes in corporate ownership and owner-occupancy across Boston from
        2004 to 2024, using property assessment-derived rates combined with neighborhood Census fields (population,
        race/ethnicity counts, and housing unit counts). The goal is not to make causal claims, but to identify
        patterns, outliers, and plausible hypotheses that can guide deeper analysis in later assignments.
      </p>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How have corporate ownership and owner-occupancy rates changed across Boston neighborhoods from 2004–2024?</li>
				<li>Are neighborhoods with higher shares of Black and Hispanic residents associated with lower owner-occupancy or higher corporate ownership?</li>
				<li>Is higher corporate ownership associated with lower housing stability indicators (e.g., vacancy rate or lower owner-occupancy)?</li>
				<li>Do neighborhoods experiencing population growth or housing unit expansion also show faster increases in corporate ownership?</li>
			</ol>

      <h3>Data used</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Corporate ownership & owner-occupancy over time (2004–2024):</strong> neighborhood-year rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Corporate ownership & owner-occupancy with Census fields:</strong> neighborhood-year rates merged with neighborhood population and housing unit counts.</li>
        <li><strong>Neighborhoods & zip codes:</strong> a lookup table used for reference/joins when needed.</li>
      </ul>

	<p class="note">
        <strong>Important note on measurement:</strong> Corporate ownership is inferred via keyword matching in owner names
        (e.g., “LLC”, “Trust”), which may undercount or misclassify some owners. Owner-occupancy and corporate ownership
        are expressed as rates (0–1) at the neighborhood-year level.

      <h2>2. Data Overview & Quality Checks</h2>

      <p>
        Before analyzing the research questions, I first examined the dataset structure (neighborhood-year records),
        checked coverage across years and neighborhoods, and inspected distributions and potential data quality issues
        (e.g., missingness, outliers, and unexpected discontinuities over time).
      </p>

      <h3>Visualization 0-a: Dataset coverage / missingness</h3>

        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_0A_coverage_missingness.png" alt="Dataset coverage and missingness by field or year" />
        <figcaption>
          Caption: (2–4 sentences) Describe how complete the dataset is across years/neighborhoods and whether key fields
          have missing values. Note any coverage gaps that could affect later comparisons (e.g., missing years or neighborhoods).
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Visualization 0-b: Distribution of corporate ownership rate (example year: 2024)</h3>

        <figcaption>
          Caption: Describe the shape (e.g., skew), typical range, and outliers for corporate ownership rates in 2024.
          Explain why this matters for later analysis (e.g., a few neighborhoods may drive overall patterns).
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

        <figcaption>
          Caption: Describe the spread of owner-occupancy rates and note which neighborhoods appear to be outliers
          (very low or very high). Mention any “gut check” expectations (e.g., central/student-heavy areas may cluster low).

      <h3>Research Question 1: How have corporate ownership and owner-occupancy rates changed across Boston neighborhoods from 2004–2024?</h3>
      <p>
        This section examines long-run ownership trends, looking for citywide shifts and neighborhood-level variation.
        I begin with overall trends, then zoom into neighborhoods with the largest changes.
      </p>

      <h4>Visualization 1-a: Neighborhood trends over time (all neighborhoods)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/Figure 1.png" alt="Ownership trends over time across all neighborhoods" />
        <figcaption>
          Caption: Describe the overall pattern across neighborhoods (e.g., whether most neighborhoods increase in corporate ownership).
          Highlight any periods of acceleration or divergence among neighborhoods.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>Visualization 1-b: Dual trend example (selected neighborhoods)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_1B_selected_dual_trends.png" alt="Selected neighborhoods showing corporate ownership and owner occupancy trends side-by-side" />
        <figcaption>
          Caption: Explain why you selected these neighborhoods (e.g., largest increases, different baseline types).
          Note whether corporate ownership increases coincide with declines in owner-occupancy.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>Visualization 1-c: Largest changes from 2004 to 2024</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_1C_delta_bar.png" alt="Bar chart of change in corporate ownership (and/or owner occupancy) from 2004 to 2024 by neighborhood" />
        <figcaption>
          Caption: Identify which neighborhoods experienced the largest increases in corporate ownership (and/or the largest declines in owner-occupancy).
          Briefly interpret what these “fast-change” neighborhoods suggest about where ownership restructuring is concentrated.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <!-- RQ2 -->
      <!-- --------------------- -->
      <h3>Research Question 2: Are neighborhoods with higher shares of Black and Hispanic residents associated with lower owner-occupancy or higher corporate ownership?</h3>
      <p>
        To explore equity implications, I compare ownership measures to neighborhood racial/ethnic composition.
        I compute demographic shares (e.g., % Black = black_all / tot_pop_all) and examine associations and outliers.
      </p>

      <h4>Visualization 2-a: Corporate ownership vs % Black (example year: 2024)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_2A_corp_vs_pct_black_2024.png" alt="Scatterplot of corporate ownership vs percent Black residents, 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          Caption: Describe whether neighborhoods with higher % Black residents tend to show higher corporate ownership.
          Call out notable outliers and explain what follow-up checks you would do (e.g., control for housing units or vacancy).
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>Visualization 2-b: Corporate ownership vs % Hispanic (example year: 2024)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_2B_corp_vs_pct_hisp_2024.png" alt="Scatterplot of corporate ownership vs percent Hispanic residents, 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          Caption: Compare this pattern to the % Black plot. Note whether the association appears stronger/weaker and what that suggests
          about how ownership restructuring aligns with demographic concentration.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>Visualization 2-c: Binned comparison (ownership by demographic tier)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_2C_binned_demographic_tiers.png" alt="Bar chart comparing average corporate ownership or owner occupancy across demographic tiers" />
        <figcaption>
          Caption: Explain how you binned neighborhoods (e.g., terciles of % residents of color). Summarize whether differences across tiers
          are meaningful and how this supports or complicates the subtheme’s equity framing.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <!-- RQ3 -->
      <!-- --------------------- -->
      <h3>Research Question 3: Is higher corporate ownership associated with lower housing stability indicators (e.g., vacancy rate or lower owner-occupancy)?</h3>
      <p>
        This section uses vacancy rate as a structural indicator that may reflect market churn or disinvestment.
        I compute vacancy rate as vacant_unit / tot_unit and examine how it relates to corporate ownership and owner-occupancy.
      </p>

      <h4>Visualization 3-a: Vacancy rate vs corporate ownership (example year: 2024)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_3A_vacancy_vs_corp_2024.png" alt="Scatterplot of vacancy rate vs corporate ownership, 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          Caption: Describe whether higher corporate ownership aligns with higher vacancy (or not). Note any neighborhoods that break the pattern,
          and what that suggests about different “types” of corporate ownership (e.g., high-demand vs disinvested areas).
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>Visualization 3-b: Vacancy rate vs owner-occupancy (example year: 2024)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_3B_vacancy_vs_ownerocc_2024.png" alt="Scatterplot of vacancy rate vs owner-occupancy, 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          Caption: Interpret how owner-occupancy relates to vacancy. If neighborhoods with low owner-occupancy show higher vacancy,
          explain why that might matter for housing stability, while noting that vacancy is not the same as eviction.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <!-- RQ4 -->
      <!-- --------------------- -->
      <h3>Research Question 4: Do neighborhoods experiencing population growth or housing unit expansion also show faster increases in corporate ownership?</h3>
      <p>
        To test whether corporate ownership growth tracks neighborhood change, I compare shifts in corporate ownership to changes
        in total population and housing units over the 2004–2024 period. I compute percent change in population and units, and
        compare these to the change in corporate ownership rate.
      </p>

      <h4>Visualization 4-a: Change in corporate ownership vs change in housing units (2004→2024)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_4A_delta_corp_vs_delta_units.png" alt="Scatterplot of change in corporate ownership vs change in housing units from 2004 to 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          Caption: Describe whether neighborhoods adding housing units also show larger corporate ownership increases.
          Note whether the relationship looks linear, clustered, or driven by a few high-growth outliers.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>Visualization 4-b: Change in corporate ownership vs change in population (2004→2024)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_4B_delta_corp_vs_delta_pop.png" alt="Scatterplot of change in corporate ownership vs change in population from 2004 to 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          Caption: Interpret whether corporate ownership growth corresponds to population growth, or whether corporate ownership rises even where
          population is stable/declining. Briefly state what hypothesis this suggests for future analysis.
        </figcaption>
