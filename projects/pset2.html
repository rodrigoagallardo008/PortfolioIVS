			<h2>Subtheme: Corporate Landlords & Evictions</h2>

			<p>
			  Prior research (such as the Homes For All report below) has shown that corporate and absentee landlords evicted more people during COVID in the state of MA. Evictions can have devastating impacts on residents, families and communities. Conversely, live-in (or live-nearby) landlords tended to file for fewer evictions, leading the report to make a recommendation that local control of property contributes to housing stability. Communities of color, especially Black and Latinx people, faced particularly high rates of eviction. Do these findings hold up in the City of Boston? Are there more evictions in census tracts with less owners living in them? How have rates of owner occupancy and corporate ownership in Boston changed over time? Are there more corporate landlords now than there have been in the past?

	      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This report explores neighborhood-level changes in corporate ownership and owner-occupancy across Boston from
        2004 to 2024, using property assessment-derived rates combined with neighborhood Census fields (population,
        race/ethnicity counts, and housing unit counts). The goal is not to make causal claims, but to identify
        patterns, outliers, and plausible hypotheses that can guide deeper analysis in later assignments.
      </p>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How have corporate ownership and owner-occupancy rates changed across Boston neighborhoods from 2004–2024?</li>
				<li>Are neighborhoods with higher shares of Black and Hispanic residents associated with lower owner-occupancy or higher corporate ownership?</li>
				<li>Is higher corporate ownership associated with lower housing stability indicators (e.g., vacancy rate or lower owner-occupancy)?</li>
				<li>Do neighborhoods experiencing population growth or housing unit expansion also show faster increases in corporate ownership?</li>
			</ol>

      <h3>Data used</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Corporate ownership & owner-occupancy over time (2004–2024):</strong> neighborhood-year rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Corporate ownership & owner-occupancy with Census fields:</strong> neighborhood-year rates merged with neighborhood population and housing unit counts.</li>
        <li><strong>Neighborhoods & zip codes:</strong> a lookup table used for reference/joins when needed.</li>
      </ul>

	<p class="note">
        <strong>Important note on measurement:</strong> Corporate ownership is inferred via keyword matching in owner names
        (e.g., “LLC”, “Trust”), which may undercount or misclassify some owners. Owner-occupancy and corporate ownership
        are expressed as rates (0–1) at the neighborhood-year level.

    <!-- ===================== -->

    <section>
      <h2>2. Data Overview & Quality Checks</h2>

      <p>
        Before analyzing the research questions, I first examined the dataset structure (neighborhood-year records),
        checked coverage across years and neighborhoods, and inspected distributions and potential data quality issues
        (e.g., missingness, outliers, and unexpected discontinuities over time).
      </p>

      <h3>Visualization 0-a: Dataset coverage / missingness</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_0A_coverage_missingness.png" alt="Dataset coverage and missingness by field or year" />
        <figcaption>
          Caption: (2–4 sentences) Describe how complete the dataset is across years/neighborhoods and whether key fields
          have missing values. Note any coverage gaps that could affect later comparisons (e.g., missing years or neighborhoods).
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Visualization 0-b: Distribution of corporate ownership rate (example year: 2024)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_0B_corp_own_distribution_2024.png" alt="Distribution of corporate ownership rate in 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          Caption: Describe the shape (e.g., skew), typical range, and outliers for corporate ownership rates in 2024.
          Explain why this matters for later analysis (e.g., a few neighborhoods may drive overall patterns).
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Visualization 0-c: Distribution of owner-occupancy rate (example year: 2024)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_0C_owner_occ_distribution_2024.png" alt="Distribution of owner-occupancy rate in 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          Caption: Describe the spread of owner-occupancy rates and note which neighborhoods appear to be outliers
          (very low or very high). Mention any “gut check” expectations (e.g., central/student-heavy areas may cluster low).
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Visualization 0-d: Citywide trend (2004–2024)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_0D_citywide_trend.png" alt="Citywide average trends in corporate ownership and owner occupancy, 2004–2024" />
        <figcaption>
          Caption: Summarize the overall direction of change for corporate ownership and owner-occupancy across the
          20-year period. Note any inflection points (e.g., post-2015 acceleration) and whether the two series appear
          inversely related.
