			<h2>Subtheme: Corporate Landlords & Evictions</h2>

			<p>
			  Prior research (such as the Homes For All report below) has shown that corporate and absentee landlords evicted more people during COVID in the state of MA. Evictions can have devastating impacts on residents, families and communities. Conversely, live-in (or live-nearby) landlords tended to file for fewer evictions, leading the report to make a recommendation that local control of property contributes to housing stability. Communities of color, especially Black and Latinx people, faced particularly high rates of eviction. Do these findings hold up in the City of Boston? Are there more evictions in census tracts with less owners living in them? How have rates of owner occupancy and corporate ownership in Boston changed over time? Are there more corporate landlords now than there have been in the past?

    <!-- 1) INTRODUCTION        -->
    <!-- ===================== -->

	    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Housing stability is shaped not only by rents and income, but also by who owns residential property. Corporate
        and absentee ownership can change the incentives and decision-making structures around housing, potentially
        affecting neighborhood stability over time. This report explores neighborhood-level changes in corporate
        ownership and owner-occupancy across Boston from 2004 to 2024, using property assessment–derived rates combined
        with neighborhood Census fields (population, race/ethnicity counts, and housing unit counts).
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of this analysis is exploratory rather than causal. I use visualizations to describe long-run trends,
        identify spatial concentration and outliers, and test whether ownership measures line up with neighborhood
        demographic composition and a structural housing indicator (vacancy). These patterns help generate plausible
        hypotheses and guide what deeper analysis would be needed to evaluate eviction-related questions more directly.
      </p>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How have corporate ownership and owner-occupancy rates changed across Boston neighborhoods from 2004–2024?</li>
				<li>Are neighborhoods with higher shares of Black and Hispanic residents associated with lower owner-occupancy or higher corporate ownership?</li>
				<li>Is higher corporate ownership associated with lower housing stability indicators (e.g., vacancy rate or lower owner-occupancy)?</li>
				<li>Do neighborhoods experiencing population growth or housing unit expansion also show faster increases in corporate ownership?</li>
			</ol>

      <h3>Data used</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Corporate ownership &amp; owner-occupancy over time (2004–2024):</strong> neighborhood-year rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Corporate ownership &amp; owner-occupancy with Census fields:</strong> neighborhood-year rates merged with neighborhood population and housing unit counts.</li>
        <li><strong>Neighborhoods &amp; zip codes:</strong> a lookup table used for reference/joins when needed.</li>
      </ul>

	<p class="note">
        <strong>Important note on measurement:</strong> Corporate ownership is inferred via keyword matching in owner names
        (e.g., “LLC”, “Trust”), which may undercount or misclassify some owners. Owner-occupancy and corporate ownership
        are expressed as rates (0–1) at the neighborhood-year level.

    <!-- 2) DATA OVERVIEW        -->
    <!-- ===================== -->

    <section>
      <h2>2. Data Overview &amp; Quality Checks</h2>

      <p>
        Before addressing the research questions, I inspected the dataset structure (neighborhood-year records),
        verified coverage across years and neighborhoods, and checked for potential data quality issues such as
        missingness, outliers, and abrupt discontinuities. This step helped confirm what the dataset can reliably
        support and flagged fields that may require caution during interpretation.
      </p>

      <h3>Visualization 0-a: Dataset coverage / missingness</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/Visualization 0A.png" alt="Dataset coverage and missingness by field or year" />
        <figcaption>
          For this first exploratory view, I focused on understanding what the dataset contains and whether anything
          looked “off” at a glance. I scanned for unusually high or low values, abrupt year-to-year jumps, and gaps
          that might indicate missing records or inconsistencies—flagging potential anomalies worth double-checking
          before moving into deeper analysis.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Visualization 0-b: Distribution of corporate ownership rate (example year: 2024)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/Visualization 0B.png" alt="Distribution of corporate ownership rate in 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          To ground later comparisons, I looked up where neighborhoods sit geographically and selected six that provide
          a broad cross-section of Boston (central, north, east, south, and outer-edge areas). This set is used as a
          consistent reference point across later trend views so comparisons are not driven only by the highest or
          lowest values.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Visualization 0-c: Distribution of owner-occupancy rate (example year: 2024)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/Visualization Owner Occupancy Top.png" alt="Distribution of owner-occupancy rate in 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          Owner-occupancy rates vary widely across neighborhoods in 2024, with the highest values concentrated in more
          residential, outer neighborhoods and the lowest values in central, development-heavy, and rental-dominant
          areas. This distribution serves as a “gut check” that Boston includes both owner-occupant–oriented housing
          markets and neighborhoods where households are far more likely to rent.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Visualization 0-d: Citywide trend (2004–2024)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/Neighborhood Corp Ownership.png" alt="Citywide average trends in corporate ownership and owner occupancy, 2004–2024" />
        <figcaption>
          Citywide averages show corporate ownership trending upward over the 2004–2024 period, while owner-occupancy is
          comparatively flat or slightly declining. The two measures move in opposite directions, suggesting a broad
          shift toward investor-owned housing. This motivates neighborhood-level analysis to see where changes are
          concentrated and whether some areas diverge from the overall pattern.

      <h2>3. Discoveries & Insights</h2>

      <!-- ===================== -->
      <!-- RQ1: Long-run trends   -->
      <!-- ===================== -->
      <h3>Research Question 1: How have corporate ownership and owner-occupancy rates changed across Boston neighborhoods from 2004–2024?</h3>
      <p>
        I begin by examining neighborhood-level time series to evaluate whether corporate ownership growth is broad-based
        across Boston or concentrated in specific neighborhoods, and whether owner-occupancy trends track inversely over time.
      </p>

      <h4>Visualization 1-a: Neighborhood trends over time (all neighborhoods)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/White Population.png" alt="Ownership trends over time across all neighborhoods" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Corporate ownership rises in most neighborhoods, but at different speeds.</strong>
          Across the 2004–2024 period, the majority of neighborhoods show an upward corporate ownership trajectory, with
          noticeable divergence in the pace of increase. A subset of central and redevelopment-intensive neighborhoods
          rise much faster than the rest, while several outer neighborhoods increase more gradually. This divergence
          suggests investor expansion is widespread but not uniform across the city.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>Visualization 1-b: Dual trend example (selected neighborhoods)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/Hispanic Population.png" alt="Selected neighborhoods showing corporate ownership and owner occupancy trends side-by-side" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>In selected neighborhoods, corporate ownership growth coincides with flatter or declining owner-occupancy.</strong>
          Using the six geographically distributed reference neighborhoods, corporate ownership trends upward in each case,
          while owner-occupancy tends to remain flat or drift downward. Some neighborhoods display especially steep
          post-2015 growth in corporate ownership, highlighting potential inflection points tied to broader market
          dynamics and redevelopment cycles.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <!-- ===================== -->
      <!-- RQ2: Where change is concentrated -->
      <!-- ===================== -->
      <h3>Research Question 2: Which neighborhoods experienced the largest shifts between 2004 and 2024?</h3>
      <p>
        To identify where ownership restructuring is most concentrated, I compare the change in corporate ownership from
        2004 to 2024 across neighborhoods and highlight the largest movers.
      </p>

      <h4>Visualization 2-a: Largest changes from 2004 to 2024</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_1C_delta_bar.png" alt="Bar chart of change in corporate ownership from 2004 to 2024 by neighborhood" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Corporate ownership growth is concentrated in a subset of neighborhoods.</strong>
          The largest increases occur in areas such as South Boston Waterfront, East Boston, and Fenway, while outer
          neighborhoods such as Hyde Park and West Roxbury increase more modestly. This spread reinforces that investor
          expansion is not uniform and may track redevelopment intensity, rental-dominant markets, and centrality.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <!-- ===================== -->
      <!-- RQ3: Demographics / equity -->
      <!-- ===================== -->
      <h3>Research Question 3: Are neighborhoods with higher shares of Black and Hispanic residents associated with higher corporate ownership or lower owner-occupancy?</h3>
      <p>
        To explore equity implications, I compare ownership measures to neighborhood racial/ethnic composition by computing
        demographic shares (e.g., % Black = black_all / tot_pop_all; % Hispanic = hisp_all / tot_pop_all). Because the analysis
        is at the neighborhood scale—and some demographic fields appear repeated across years—these results should be interpreted
        as descriptive snapshots rather than evidence of demographic change over time.
      </p>

      <h4>Visualization 3-a: Corporate ownership vs % Black (2024)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/White Population.png" alt="Scatterplot of corporate ownership vs percent Black residents, 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>At the neighborhood scale, the highest corporate ownership is not in the highest-% Black neighborhoods.</strong>
          In 2024, corporate ownership appears negatively associated with % Black residents at this aggregation level, with the
          highest corporate ownership concentrated in central neighborhoods that are not the highest-% Black. This complicates a
          simple citywide narrative and suggests that factors like centrality, housing stock, and investor-targeted redevelopment
          may shape ownership restructuring patterns.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>Visualization 3-b: Corporate ownership vs % Hispanic (2024)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/Hispanic Population.png" alt="Scatterplot of corporate ownership vs percent Hispanic residents, 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>The relationship with % Hispanic is weaker overall, with meaningful neighborhood exceptions.</strong>
          Compared with % Black, the overall association between corporate ownership and % Hispanic is weaker in this dataset.
          However, some neighborhoods combine relatively high Hispanic share with relatively high corporate ownership, suggesting
          localized dynamics that a citywide linear trend may not fully capture.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>Visualization 3-c: Binned comparison (ownership by demographic tier)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_2C_binned_demographic_tiers.png" alt="Bar chart comparing average corporate ownership across demographic tiers" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Binning neighborhoods helps summarize equity patterns beyond individual outliers.</strong>
          Grouping neighborhoods into tiers based on demographic share provides a clearer summary than individual neighborhood points.
          In this dataset, tier differences appear modest, suggesting that—at the neighborhood scale—ownership restructuring patterns
          are not explained by demographics alone and likely reflect an interaction with geography and market structure.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>Visualization 3-d: Population comparison maps (Black, White, Hispanic)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/Population Comparison.png" alt="Maps comparing neighborhood counts for Black, White, and Hispanic populations" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Population maps contextualize demographic comparisons spatially.</strong>
          Mapping neighborhood counts for Black, White, and Hispanic populations helps interpret the demographic scatterplots by showing
          where populations are concentrated geographically. These maps also reinforce that demographic composition varies strongly across
          Boston neighborhoods, which may interact with redevelopment intensity and housing market type in shaping ownership outcomes.
        </figcaption>

      <!-- ===================== -->
      <!-- RQ4: Housing stability proxy -->
      <!-- ===================== -->
      <h3>Research Question 4: Is higher corporate ownership associated with higher vacancy or lower owner-occupancy as a housing stability proxy?</h3>
      <p>
        Because eviction filings are not directly included in the provided dataset, I use vacancy rate as a structural indicator
        that may reflect housing churn or speculative holding. Vacancy rate is computed as vacant_unit / tot_unit and compared to
        corporate ownership and owner-occupancy.
      </p>

      <h4>Visualization 4-a: Vacancy rate vs corporate ownership (2024)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_3A_vacancy_vs_corp_2024.png" alt="Scatterplot of vacancy rate vs corporate ownership, 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Higher corporate ownership is associated with higher vacancy in 2024.</strong>
          Neighborhoods with higher corporate ownership tend to show higher vacancy rates, with several central neighborhoods standing out
          for combining both. While vacancy is not the same as eviction, this pattern may help flag neighborhoods where investor ownership
          aligns with structural indicators of housing turnover or instability.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>Visualization 4-b: Vacancy rate vs owner-occupancy (2024)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/FIGURE_3B_vacancy_vs_ownerocc_2024.png" alt="Scatterplot of vacancy rate vs owner-occupancy, 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Owner-occupancy is inversely related to vacancy, reinforcing a stability contrast across neighborhoods.</strong>
          Neighborhoods with higher owner-occupancy generally have lower vacancy, while low owner-occupancy neighborhoods are more likely to
          show elevated vacancy. Together with the long-run trends, this suggests that investor-heavy neighborhoods may exhibit structural
          signals consistent with greater churn, even if the dataset cannot directly measure evictions.

    <!-- ===================== -->
    <section>
      <h2>5. Summary</h2>

      <p>
        This exploratory analysis suggests that Boston has experienced a long-run shift toward investor-owned housing from 2004 to 2024.
        Corporate ownership increases in nearly every neighborhood, but the magnitude of change is uneven and appears concentrated in
        central and redevelopment-intensive areas. Owner-occupancy is comparatively flat or modestly declining, reinforcing a broader
        restructuring of neighborhood housing markets.
      </p>

      <p>
        Demographic comparisons at the neighborhood scale show that corporate ownership is not highest in the highest-% Black neighborhoods,
        and the relationship with % Hispanic is weaker overall, with meaningful localized exceptions. This implies that ownership restructuring
        does not map cleanly onto neighborhood racial composition at this aggregation level and may be shaped by spatial market dynamics such
        as centrality, housing stock, and redevelopment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, corporate ownership is associated with higher vacancy and lower owner-occupancy in 2024, which may reflect structural
        signals consistent with housing churn. However, vacancy is not equivalent to eviction, and this dataset does not directly measure
        eviction filings. A key next step would be to pair tract-level ownership patterns with eviction records to evaluate whether higher
        corporate ownership predicts higher eviction rates within Boston.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        <strong>Limitations:</strong> corporate ownership is inferred from owner-name keyword matching; neighborhood aggregation can hide within-neighborhood
        variation; and eviction filings are not included in the provided files.
