			<h2>Subtheme: Corporate Landlords & Evictions</h2>

			<p>
			  Prior research (such as the Homes For All report below) has shown that corporate and absentee landlords evicted more people during COVID in the state of MA. Evictions can have devastating impacts on residents, families and communities. Conversely, live-in (or live-nearby) landlords tended to file for fewer evictions, leading the report to make a recommendation that local control of property contributes to housing stability. Communities of color, especially Black and Latinx people, faced particularly high rates of eviction. Do these findings hold up in the City of Boston? Are there more evictions in census tracts with less owners living in them? How have rates of owner occupancy and corporate ownership in Boston changed over time? Are there more corporate landlords now than there have been in the past?

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How is racial segregation distributed across Greater Boston today?</li>
				<li>How does affordability vary across space, and does it track segregation?</li>
				<li>Are “high-growth / high-development” areas becoming more exclusive?</li>
				<li>Where are displacement pressures concentrated, and who is most exposed?</li>
			</ol>
