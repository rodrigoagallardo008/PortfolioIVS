			<h2>Subtheme: Corporate Landlords & Evictions</h2>

			<p>
			  Prior research (such as the Homes For All report below) has shown that corporate and absentee landlords evicted more people during COVID in the state of MA. Evictions can have devastating impacts on residents, families and communities. Conversely, live-in (or live-nearby) landlords tended to file for fewer evictions, leading the report to make a recommendation that local control of property contributes to housing stability. Communities of color, especially Black and Latinx people, faced particularly high rates of eviction. Do these findings hold up in the City of Boston? Are there more evictions in census tracts with less owners living in them? How have rates of owner occupancy and corporate ownership in Boston changed over time? Are there more corporate landlords now than there have been in the past?
			</p>

	<!-- ===================== -->
    <!-- 1) INTRODUCTION        -->
    <!-- ===================== -->

	    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Housing stability is shaped not only by rents and income, but also by who owns residential property. Corporate
        and absentee ownership can change the incentives and decision-making structures around housing, potentially
        affecting neighborhood stability over time. This report explores neighborhood-level changes in corporate
        ownership and owner-occupancy across Boston from 2004 to 2024, using property assessment–derived rates combined
        with neighborhood Census fields (population, race/ethnicity counts, and housing unit counts).
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of this analysis is exploratory rather than causal. I use visualizations to describe long-run trends,
        identify spatial concentration and outliers, and test whether ownership measures line up with neighborhood
        demographic composition and a structural housing indicator (vacancy). These patterns help generate plausible
        hypotheses and guide what deeper analysis would be needed to evaluate eviction-related questions more directly.
      </p>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How have corporate ownership and owner-occupancy rates changed across Boston neighborhoods from 2004–2024?</li>
				<li>Are neighborhoods with higher shares of Black and Hispanic residents associated with lower owner-occupancy or higher corporate ownership?</li>
				<li>Is higher corporate ownership associated with lower housing stability indicators (e.g., vacancy rate or lower owner-occupancy)?</li>
				<li>Do neighborhoods experiencing population growth or housing unit expansion also show faster increases in corporate ownership?</li>
			</ol>

      <h3>Data used</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Corporate ownership &amp; owner-occupancy over time (2004–2024):</strong> neighborhood-year rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Corporate ownership &amp; owner-occupancy with Census fields:</strong> neighborhood-year rates merged with neighborhood population and housing unit counts.</li>
        <li><strong>Neighborhoods &amp; zip codes:</strong> a lookup table used for reference/joins when needed.</li>
      </ul>

	<p class="note">
        <strong>Important note on measurement:</strong> Corporate ownership is inferred via keyword matching in owner names
        (e.g., “LLC”, “Trust”), which may undercount or misclassify some owners. Owner-occupancy and corporate ownership
        are expressed as rates (0–1) at the neighborhood-year level.

    <!-- 2) DATA OVERVIEW        -->
    <!-- ===================== -->

    <section>
      <h2>2. Data Overview &amp; Quality Checks</h2>

      <p>
        Before addressing the research questions, I inspected the dataset structure (neighborhood-year records),
        verified coverage across years and neighborhoods, and checked for potential data quality issues such as
        missingness, outliers, and abrupt discontinuities. This step helped confirm what the dataset can reliably
        support and flagged fields that may require caution during interpretation.
      </p>

      <h3>Visualization 0-a: Dataset coverage / missingness</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/Visualization 0A.png" alt="Dataset coverage and missingness by field or year" />
        <figcaption>
          For this first exploratory view, I focused on understanding what the dataset contains and whether anything
          looked “off” at a glance. I scanned for unusually high or low values, abrupt year-to-year jumps, and gaps
          that might indicate missing records or inconsistencies—flagging potential anomalies worth double-checking
          before moving into deeper analysis.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img src="pset2figures/Visualization 0B.png" alt="Distribution of corporate ownership rate in 2024" />
        <figcaption>
          To ground later comparisons, I looked up where neighborhoods sit geographically and selected six that provide
          a broad cross-section of Boston (central, north, east, south, and outer-edge areas). This set is used as a
          consistent reference point across later trend views so comparisons are not driven only by the highest or
          lowest values.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Visualization 0-c: Distribution of owner-occupancy rate (example year: 2024)</h3>

          Here I wanted to visulize quickly what the nieghborhood has the highest Owner occucpancy rate, just to get
          a general idea of what I was looking for, or if this couud give m abette undersntaind. Here WEst Roxbury, Rosindae and Hyde PArk 
          are shown to to be the higheres with OWner Occupancy all of which can be catergorized as somwheat suburnan areas.

  <h2>3. Discoveries &amp; Insights</h2>

  <!-- ===================== -->
  <!-- RQ1: Long-run trends   -->
  <!-- ===================== -->
  <h3>Research Question 1: How have corporate ownership and owner-occupancy rates changed across Boston neighborhoods from 2004–2024?</h3>
  <p>
    I begin by examining neighborhood-level time series to evaluate whether corporate ownership growth is broad-based
    across Boston or concentrated in specific neighborhoods, and whether owner-occupancy trends move inversely over time.
  </p>

  <h4>Visualization 1-A: White Population (all neighborhoods)</h4>
  <figure>
    <img src="pset2figures/White Population CROP.png" alt="Map of neighborhoods with high White population (placeholder)" />
    <figcaption>
      <strong>Context map: predominantly White neighborhoods.</strong>
      I first mapped neighborhoods with high White population to understand the spatial distribution of this group
      and establish a baseline comparison for later demographic case studies.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h4>Visualization 1-B: Hispanic Population (selected neighborhoods)</h4>
  <figure>
    <img src="pset2figures/Hispanic Population CROP.png" alt="Map of neighborhoods with high Hispanic population (placeholder)" />
    <figcaption>
      <strong>Hispanic population is concentrated in East Boston and Dorchester.</strong>
      This aligns with my expectations and provides a useful anchor for interpreting ownership patterns in neighborhoods
      that function as cultural hubs for Boston’s Hispanic community.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h4>Visualization 1-C: Black Population (selected neighborhoods)</h4>
  <figure>
    <img src="pset2figures/Black Population CROP.png" alt="Map of neighborhoods with high Black population (placeholder)" />
    <figcaption>
      <strong>Black population is concentrated in Roxbury and Dorchester.</strong>
      This map helps contextualize later comparisons by showing where Boston’s Black communities are geographically concentrated.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <!-- ===================== -->
  <!-- RQ2: Where change is concentrated -->
  <!-- ===================== -->
  <h3>Research Question 2: Which neighborhoods experienced the largest shifts between 2004 and 2024?</h3>
  <p>
    To identify where ownership restructuring is most concentrated, I compare the change in corporate ownership from
    2004 to 2024 across neighborhoods and highlight the largest movers.
  </p>

  <h4>Visualization 2-A: Largest changes from 2004 to 2024</h4>
  <figure>
    <img src="pset2figures/Population Comparison with Color.png" alt="Change in corporate ownership from 2004 to 2024 by neighborhood (placeholder)" />
    <figcaption>
      <strong>Corporate ownership growth is concentrated in a subset of neighborhoods.</strong>
      Regionally, this view helped me connect demographic concentration with ownership change and consider whether
      long-standing patterns of segregation may interact with redevelopment and investor activity.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <!-- ===================== -->
  <!-- RQ3: Demographics / equity -->
  <!-- ===================== -->
  <h3>Research Question 3: Are neighborhoods with higher shares of Black and Hispanic residents associated with higher corporate ownership or lower owner-occupancy?</h3>
  <p>
    To explore equity implications, I compare ownership measures to neighborhood racial/ethnic composition by computing
    demographic shares (e.g., % Black = black_all / tot_pop_all; % Hispanic = hisp_all / tot_pop_all). Because the analysis
    is at the neighborhood scale—and some demographic fields appear repeated across years—these results should be interpreted
    as descriptive snapshots rather than evidence of demographic change over time.
  </p>

    <figcaption>
      <strong>Outer neighborhoods remain more owner-occupied; central neighborhoods trend more corporate-owned.</strong>
      In more outer, suburban-like neighborhoods, owner-occupancy stays relatively high, while more central areas show
      stronger growth in corporate ownership over time.

    <figcaption>
      <strong>East Boston stands out as a Hispanic hub with rising corporate ownership.</strong>
      Compared with more peripheral neighborhoods, East Boston shows stronger growth in corporate ownership, suggesting
      that investor expansion may intersect with culturally significant neighborhoods in locally important ways.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h4>Visualization 3-C: Predominantly Black neighborhoods (ownership trends)</h4>
  <figure>

    <figcaption>
      <strong>Roxbury and Dorchester show rising corporate ownership over time.</strong>
      Even though corporate ownership is not universally highest in the highest-% Black neighborhoods citywide, these
      neighborhoods show meaningful increases over the 2004–2024 period.

    <figcaption>
      <strong>Population maps contextualize demographic comparisons spatially.</strong>
      Mapping neighborhood counts for Black, White, and Hispanic populations helps interpret demographic comparisons by showing
      where populations are concentrated geographically.

  <!-- RQ4: Housing stability proxy -->
  <!-- ===================== -->
  <h3>Research Question 4: Is higher corporate ownership associated with housing instability indicators?</h3>
  <p>
    Because the provided dataset includes housing-type categories (e.g., correctional, nursing, etc.), I explored whether these
    categories show geographic clustering and whether they co-occur with higher corporate ownership in specific neighborhoods.
  </p>

  <h4>Visualization 4-A: Housing Types (geographic distribution)</h4>
  <figure>
    <img src="pset2figures/Housing Types.png" alt="Housing types by neighborhood (placeholder)" />
    <figcaption>
      Housing types show geographic clustering across Boston. This view helps frame whether areas with specific housing
      institutions (e.g., correctional facilities, nursing homes) overlap with investor ownership patterns.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h4>Visualization 4-B: Housing Type and Ownership</h4>
  <figure>
    <img src="pset2figures/Housing Type and Ownership.png" alt="Ownership vs housing type by neighborhood (placeholder)" />
    <figcaption>
      This comparison suggests that some neighborhoods with concentrated institutional housing types also show higher
      corporate ownership. This raises a follow-up question: how much of corporate ownership is driven by development type
      and who is building or holding these properties?

<!-- 5) SUMMARY              -->
<!-- ===================== -->
<section>
  <h2>5. Summary</h2>

  <p>
    From 2004 to 2024, Boston shows a broad shift toward higher corporate ownership alongside a gradual decline in owner-occupancy.
    While most neighborhoods trend in the same direction, the pace differs substantially, suggesting investor expansion is uneven
    across the city.
  </p>

  <figure class="half">
    <img src="pset2figures/Neighborhood Corp Ownership.png"
         alt="Citywide trends in corporate ownership and owner-occupancy, 2004–2024 (placeholder)" />
    <figcaption>
      Citywide averages show rising corporate ownership over time with a modest decline in owner-occupancy.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Neighborhoods with the fastest increases tend to be shaped by redevelopment, centrality, or high rental demand
    (e.g., Downtown, Fenway, South Boston Waterfront). In contrast, outer neighborhoods such as West Roxbury and Hyde Park
    remain comparatively more owner-occupied and show slower growth in investor ownership.
  </p>

  <p>
    Adding demographic context complicates a simple equity narrative. At the neighborhood scale, corporate ownership is not uniformly
    highest in neighborhoods with the largest shares of Black residents. However, historically Black communities such as
    <strong>Roxbury</strong> and parts of <strong>Dorchester</strong> still show meaningful increases in corporate ownership over time.
    Roxbury stands out as both a long-standing cultural hub of Boston’s Black community and a neighborhood where investor ownership
    rises steadily across the time window.
  </p>

  <figure class="half">
    <img src="pset2figures/Roxbury.jpg" alt="Roxbury case figure (placeholder)" />
    <figcaption>
      Roxbury and Dorchester appear as key hubs for Boston’s Black population and show rising corporate ownership over time.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    A parallel case emerges for <strong>East Boston</strong>, which functions as an immigrant gateway neighborhood and a major hub for
    Boston’s Hispanic community. East Boston combines a high Hispanic share with strong growth in corporate ownership, suggesting that
    investor expansion may intersect with culturally significant neighborhoods in locally important ways.
  </p>

  <figure class="half">
    <img src="pset2figures/East boston.jpg" alt="East Boston case figure (placeholder)" />
    <figcaption>
      East Boston appears as a prominent Hispanic hub and shows visible growth in corporate ownership over time.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Overall, these patterns motivate a next step: pairing tract-level corporate ownership with eviction filings (if available) to test whether
    investor ownership is associated with eviction risk and whether that relationship differs for culturally significant neighborhoods such as
    Roxbury and East Boston.
